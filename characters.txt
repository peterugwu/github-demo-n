A cashier at Monk's Caf√© whom George once accused of stealing a $20 bill with lipstick drawn on the president. She is visible in the background as the cashier at Monk's in almost every episode that features the interior of the cafe as a setting.
Fellow tenant in Jerry and Kramer's apartment building. A heavyset male U.S. postal worker and Jerry's nemesis. A catchphrase of Jerry's is that he greets him with a contemptuous disdainful "Hello, Newman" each time they meet. In "The Raincoats", Helen Seinfeld addresses Newman with the same tone. In "The Revenge," only Newman's voice is heard, which was originally voiced by Larry David and rerecorded for syndication. Newman often speaks in an exaggeratedly dramatic, Shakespearean way, and generally has a more advanced vocabulary than other characters. Newman is also noted for his poetry.
His first name appears to be unknown by any of the characters, even his employer; in "The Package" his business card gives his name merely as "NEWMAN." A minor character calls him "Norman" in "The Bottle Deposit," but this was a mistake on the part of the actress/character, rather than any revelation of Newman's first name. Newman is petty, vindictive, prone to hysteria, and often depicted as a stereotypical evil genius, who is usually undermined in some way. Jerry's exasperation or epiphany involving Newman will cause him to clench his fist and mutter "Newman!" under his breath. Newman and Kramer are usually depicted as casual friends, and the two sometimes participate in various unsuccessful moneymaking schemes together.

Newman has been shown to harbor unrequited romantic feelings for Elaine.unsuccessful
